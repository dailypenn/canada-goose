## Installation ðŸš€

1. Clone the repo.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dailypenn/canada-goose.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages.
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
For most purposes, you should use the `development` branch. If you are using the `master` branch, you must set up the iOS app credentials locally:

3. Update `credentials.json` with local iOS credentials (**`master`** branch only!)
   1. Get distribution certificate from Apple Developer Portal and update path and password.
   ```json
   "distributionCertificate": {
    "path": "ios/certs/<DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE>.p12",
    "password": "<DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD>"
   }
   ```
   2. Download provisioning profiles from Apple Developer Portal and update paths. The main app target and the OneSignalNotificationServiceExtension require separate provisioning profiles. For `local` and `development` EAS builds, the provisioning profiles should be of type **Ad hoc**. For `production` EAS builds, the provisioning profiles should be of type **App Store**. 
   ```json
   "provisioningProfilePath": "ios/certs/.../<PROVISIONING_PROFILE>.mobileprovision"
   ```
4. If you want to run the app directly on your device, you must first register the device with Expo. Otherwise, feel free to skip this step.
   ```sh
   eas device:create
   ```
5. Build the app. This may take a while, but you don't have to repeat this process unless you change the underlying native code powering the app!
   ```sh
   eas build --profile <profile-name> --platform <platform>
   ```
   1. `<platform>` should be `ios`, `android`, or `all`
   2. `<profile-name>` should be either `development` (to run the app on your device), `local` (to run the app on an iOS simulator), or `production` (to create a production build for submission).
6. Start the app.
   ```sh
   expo start --dev-client
   ```
   If you are developing against a physical device, scan the resulting QR code. Otherwise, press the "a" or "i" key to open the app in an Android emulator or iPhone simulator respectively.
