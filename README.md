## Installation üöÄ

1. Clone the repo.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dailypenn/canada-goose.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages.
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

> üîî **Note: For most purposes, you should use the `development` branch. If you are using the `master` branch, you must set up the iOS app credentials locally:**

3. (**`master` branch only!**) Update `credentials.json` with local iOS credentials
   1. Get distribution certificate from Apple Developer Portal and update path and password.
   ```json
   "distributionCertificate": {
    "path": "ios/certs/<DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE>.p12",
    "password": "<DISTRIBUTION_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD>"
   }
   ```
   2. Download provisioning profiles from Apple Developer Portal and update paths. The main app target and the OneSignalNotificationServiceExtension require separate provisioning profiles. For `local` and `development` EAS builds, the provisioning profiles should be of type **Ad hoc**. For `production` EAS builds, the provisioning profiles should be of type **App Store**. 
   ```json
   "provisioningProfilePath": "ios/certs/.../<PROVISIONING_PROFILE>.mobileprovision"
   ```
4. If you want to run the app directly on your device, you must first register the device with Expo. Otherwise, feel free to skip this step.
   ```sh
   eas device:create
   ```
5. Build the app. This may take a while, but you don't have to repeat this process unless you change the underlying native code powering the app!
   ```sh
   eas build --profile <profile-name> --platform <platform>
   ```
   1. `<platform>` should be `ios`, `android`, or `all`
   2. `<profile-name>` should be either `development` (to run the app on your device), `local` (to run the app on an iOS simulator), or `production` (to create a production build for submission).
      1. For a `local` build:
         * Download the build once it is completed from the link provided. This will be a¬†.tar.gz¬†file.
         * Extract the file by opening it. You will now have a file like¬†DP.app.
         * Open up your simulator.
         * Drag the file into the simulator.
         * The app will be installed in a few seconds.
      2. In React Native versions 0.69 and prior, there is a known bug in node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga/yoga/Yoga.cpp which prevents Fastlane from building correctly on Expo. See the official issue here [React Native Issue #36758](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/36758). Follow the steps below to apply a development patch **only if needed**.
         * Install [patch-package](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package)
         * Modify the source code similar to this [commit](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/52d8a797e7a6be3fa472f323ceca4814a28ef596)
         * Run ```npx patch-package react-native```
         * Reminder: these steps should only be run if expo cannot build due to the exact bug described in the issue.
6. Start the app.
   ```sh
   expo start --dev-client
   ```
   If you are developing against a physical device, scan the resulting QR code. Otherwise, press the "a" or "i" key to open the app in an Android emulator or iPhone simulator respectively.

## Operation Canada Goose ‚ùì

Tasked with migrating content from the harsh winter envrionment of print publication to the temperate oasis of mobile communication, DP Developers faced a challenge like no other: what do we name our objective? It wasn't until we passed the hundredth person with an overpriced winter jacket that we found an animal which so accurately captured the migratory nature of our mission and Penn culture as a whole. And so, equipped with a fitting name, we hatched our plan.

**Operation Canada Goose is here to bring you the best of The Daily Pennyslvanian, straight to your down jacket pockets.**
