# Installation Guide

Install [Expo App](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/#2-expo-client-app-for-ios-and) on your mobile.

```
npm install
expo start
```

Once the QR code is generated, open the camera on your phone to scan the code. You should be prompted to open Expo.

If you are prompted to install _Expo CLI_ globally, enter Y.

If there is globalDeprecated errors, run `expo r -c` to start the app instead of `expo start`. This clears the expo cache.
